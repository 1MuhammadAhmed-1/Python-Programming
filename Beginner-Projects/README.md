# Beginner Projects 🐍

This folder contains a collection of beginner-level Python scripts created as part of my learning journey. Each project focuses on practicing key concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and user input.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. `Simple_Car_Game.py`
A basic text-based car simulation game. The user can start, stop, and get help on commands. Great practice for loops and conditional logic.

### 2. `Weight_converter.py`
Converts weight between pounds and kilograms. Demonstrates user input and basic unit conversion.

### 3. `grades_tracker.py`
Calculates the total and average of a list of grades. Reinforces list operations and looping through data.

### 4. `num2words.py`
Custom implementation that converts an integer number into its English word representation using dictionaries. Avoids external libraries to improve core logic-building.

### 5. `prime_upto.py`
Prints all prime numbers up to a user-specified number. A solid example of using loops and conditionals in number theory problems.

## ✅ Purpose

This folder is intended to:
- Document progress through small Python exercises
- Serve as a reference point for basic syntax and logic
- Lay the groundwork for more advanced scripting and projects

## 📌 Note

All scripts are written in Python, and kept intentionally beginner-friendly.
