# 🎵 Music Recommender using Decision Tree

This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** from `scikit-learn` to predict music genres based on a user's **age** and **gender**.

## 📁 Files

- `music.csv` – Dataset containing user age, gender, and preferred music genre.
- `music-recommender.dot` – Graphviz `.dot` file used for visualizing the trained decision tree.
- `music-recommender.py` or `.ipynb` – Script or notebook that trains the model and exports the tree structure.

## 📌 Features

- Trains a simple Decision Tree model.
- Predicts genre preferences based on input features.
- Exports the trained decision tree in `.dot` format for visualization.

## 📋 Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
